   11    title: 'Hunger by Roxane Gay',
   12:   description: 'In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as wildly undisciplined, Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she explores her past—including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life—and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself.\n With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved—in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.',

But listen, EVERY BODY IS A BEACH BODY! Come as you are and know that you are with a group of people who just want to spend time with other like-minded women for a day of fun!

We bought a website in 2008 and started an s corp. in 2009 we became active. A service business. We access or help insurance adjusters access steep and tall homes/buildings. In a predominantly male market it's hard to be taken professionally. Man times the clients are older than myself and my mother and have been in the industry for years. Since we are at the bottom of the totem pole offering services, we get yelled at when things don't go right. Sometimes it's even a typo in their end in the request form. Although most of the men are very polite, we often run into men being rude after discovering the business is run by women. I assume a woman who owns a construction company would be treated the same."

While managing it (I sold fertility/maternity products mostly) I got an idea for a product for pregnant women so I started a company (August 2011) and after lots of trouble with finding and dealing with manufacturers the product is finally ready and is being shipped overseas to us, we´ll launch the website in a few weeks hopefully. I'm the CEO and co-founder. An acquaintance (another woman) is the other founder and she's in sales. So far I've been in charge of designing the product, contacting factories and agents, raising money, dealing with graphic designers, setting up the website and probably a lot of other things I'm forgetting. I come from a pretty gender equal country and must say that being a woman has mostly opened doors for me, for example I've received 2 grants and 1 business loan only available for women."

I didn’t have great communities like Elpha. I didn’t have a network of people who were in the space I was trying to move to, so I read all the industry news I could, networked so not comfortably and kept learning. Communities like this make it easier and less lonely, so feel free to reach out."
