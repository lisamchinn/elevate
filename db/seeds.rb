  description: 'In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as wildly undisciplined, Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she explores her past—including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life—and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself.\n With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved—in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.',

Join the Girls in Tech, San Francisco chapter for our 3rd annual Hacking for Humanity hackathon. This year, we’re focusing on tackling topics that deal with local San Francisco/Bay Area issues such as (but not limited to) the following:


      – Homelessness
      – Affordable Housing
      – Economic Disparity
      – Transportation



Hackathons exist to enable the rapid prototyping of a complex problem and provide a range of solutions in a short period of time. By hacking with us, we are aiming to think bigger for global change with tech, whilst also allowing impassioned women to engage in innovation and entrepreneurship within our tech ecosystem.


We are calling all women and men across the globe, including developers, designers, product developers, and entrepreneurs, plus businesses that want to embrace the idea of Social Innovation or initiatives that combine a positive mission with business.


This hackathon is beginner friendly and for participants new to coding or hackathons. However, any and all levels are welcome. You can come with your own team (no more than 5 per team). No team? No problem –  we’ll figure that out for you. Form a team, solve a problem, create something awesome, present it to the audience and win prizes!',

  description: 'Can a deeper sense of spirituality help us answer the question “why am I here”?

At some point in our lives we have all asked ourselves if there is a meaning to this life. Writers, philosophers, scientists, and almost all other disciplines in existence are trying to answer these two fundamental questions: who am I? And why am I here? As individuals, we try to find the answers in our jobs, in our family, in our relationships, etc. – but do we each have a greater purpose beyond our day to day lives? How can we orient ourselves to achieving our true purpose as individuals and as communities? And is it possible to discover that purpose in a vacuum, or do we need to take ourselves out of isolation?

Come join a different kind of conversation – one that welcomes every perspective in a search for the truths that unite us all – as we discuss the spiritual perspective offered by the Bahá’i Teachings on the role of spirituality in finding our true purpose. Join us for a lively discussion as we explore how we can create the conditions in our communities so that every individual can achieve that purpose as we walk together on a path of service.

“The whole duty of man in this Day is to attain that share of the flood of grace which God poureth forth for him.” – Bahá’i Teachings

DETAILS ABOUT TWO AWARD-WINNING FILMS & PANELISTS:

JANE: AN ABORTION SERVICE [masked] - before Roe v Wade)

This fascinating political look at a little-known chapter in women\'s history tells the story of Jane, the Chicago-based women\'s health group who performed nearly 12,000 safe illegal abortions between 1969 and 1973 with no formal medical training. As Jane members describe finding feminism and clients describe finding Jane, archival footage and recreations mingle to depict how the repression of the early sixties and social movements of the late sixties influenced this unique group. Both vital knowledge and meditation on the process of empowerment, Jane: An Abortion Service showcases the importance of preserving women\'s knowledge in the face of revisionist history.

Panel Discussion:

Lani Jo Leigh is Clinton Street independent theater owner, activist and community builder who was one of the “girls” sent away to give birth.

Judith Arcana is an artist, activist and was one of the “Janes”.

These women will share what it was like BEFORE Roe V Wade and how you can stand up and fight back for you own personal autonomy!',

What Should I Bring?
Yourself, whatever bathing attire you\'re comfortable in, sunscreen, towels, water, some snacks and anything you would like to drink. If everyone is up for it, we might also hit up the Arepa bar for something to munch on and drink as well!

When?
Saturday, August 10th from 11 AM-2PM

Since we are at the bottom of the totem pole offering services, we get yelled at when things don't go right. Sometimes it's even a typo in their end in the request form.

I'm the CEO and co-founder. An acquaintance (another woman) is the other founder and she's in sales. So far I've been in charge of designing the product, contacting factories and agents, raising money, dealing with graphic designers, setting up the website and probably a lot of other things I'm forgetting. 3.

And how are you bringing in business?’ And networking is really an important part of that.",

  content: "LOVE this plea to get more women into cybersecurity. For me at least, there is a daunting amount of things to learn and so many folks who have been at it longer that sometimes it makes me feel like I am an imposter in this space - even though I've been working in it for nearly 5+ years.",
  content: "My Masters is in Information Security, but I've never felt confident enough that I know any of the technical side of it - especially since I got my Masters 7 years ago and times have changed! And most of the cybersecurity/InfoSec positions within my company require some of that technical knowledge, so it's a barrier for me to even apply for those positions.",
  content: "I completely agree with the things mentioned above- and the statistics puts everything in so much perspective. From experience, it is really intimidating at first as most mentors I've been assigned have been older, white men, and a lot of the discussions I'm having have been with and in front of men. As someone who is a lot younger and also a female with limited help from other women in the specific field of cybersecurity, it's been difficult to be taken seriously!"

  content: "I'm introverted with a quiet voice who has no natural 'authorative aura' or whatever. I usually inevitably disappear into the background and it's from there I prefer to have my influence on things. I could say it depends on the situation, but that's looking at it idealistically. Realistically speaking, I've always fallen into the role of the follower. If I am being told to do something, whether it be at a job, uni, or elsewhere, I do it, and I tend to do it to the word, precisely. I take things rather literally and can't stand vague directions.",

What would you do?"

BUILDING_CONFIDENCE_REPLIES = [ {
  content: "Ask for what you want! It’s simple enough but let’s face it, too often we dilute what we ask for or we don’t ask at all for fear of appearing needy or being rejected. But how can you can’t expect to get what you want if you’re not willing to ask for it? There’s a direct correlation between getting what you want and asking for it. Ask big.",
  content: "Say no. It’s a short little word but it’s one many women struggle to say because we know it’s not the answer people want to hear and let’s face it, we love keeping people happy! But if you’re ever going to make your biggest mark on the world, you’ve got to learn to say no to the \"good\" so you can create space for \"great.\"",
  content: "Yes, you’re a nice person and you’re loathe to be a trouble-maker, but if all you ever do is nod your head, smile politely and \"go along to get along,\" then you are selling yourself short. Way short. As social beings we are wired to belong to a \"tribe\", but too often we let our fear of disapproval keep us from confidently expressing our opinion. Pushing back is not about being pushy. It’s simply owning your right to see things differently than others. Sure, women have been called bossy for simply speaking their truth, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t speak up."
